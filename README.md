# Question-Rewrite-Project

## Project Overview

This repository explores the use of transformer models, specifically T5-small, to enhance the quality of questions by rewriting disfluent and unclear text into refined and concise versions. The project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to eliminate disfluencies, filler words, and irrelevant content, thereby improving the clarity and precision of questions.

The dataset comprises paired disfluent and original questions, which were preprocessed and analyzed to identify key patterns in word choice and length. The T5-small model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in generating clearer and more direct questions.

This research contributes to developing automated solutions for question refinement, with potential applications in educational technology, customer support, and AI-driven communication tools.

The Question Re-write model was able to acheive around 80% score, as you can see in below figure. As I was having hardward constraints, I was unable to work on multiple hyper-parameter tuning results and companring it with other powerful models. In future, it would be implemented.
